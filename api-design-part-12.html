              <p>API design is Hard. I've made many good and bad decisions when designing
APIs and I hope this blog post will guide people into designing better
APIs. It's a pretty meaty subject, so I've broken it down into two
parts. This first part focuses on the actual design process for APIs.
The second part focuses on the tools and techniques you can use when
designing APIs.</p>
<p><strong>What is an API?</strong></p>
<p>I don't mean a textbook definition, which Google defines as:</p>
<blockquote>
a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of
applications which access the features or data of an operating
system, application, or other service.</blockquote>
<p>I don't find this particularly helpful, as it's hard to map this
statement to what I do every day. My hand-wavey definition would be that
&quot;An API is the way a developer interacts with your code.&quot;</p>
<p>This is short and sweet but has a few key points:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>It is &quot;*The One True Way*&quot;.</strong> The API is the de jure way of
accessing your code and logic. This is the way you <em>intend
for</em>developers to use your code. This doesn't always match reality.
If the API is lacking or unclear, all too often practices like
accessing private fields or functions or relying on undocumented
side-effects creep in. People start to rely on this, and it ends up
becoming the <em>de facto</em>way developers interact with your API. At
this point, it is no longer your API, but a modified version of it
which is often more practical to the problem domain.</li>
<li><strong>It is for developers.</strong> Ultimately, other people in the profession
are your target audience. They may be web developers half way around
the world in the case of REST APIs. They may be a work colleague in
the case of internal company APIs. It may even be <em>yourself</em>several
years later when you've forgotten what you've done. More generally,
the person using your API has some knowledge of the
<em>underlying</em>domain in question (e.g. it's a REST API, so you're
using HTTP) but may not have knowledge of the <em>specific</em>domain that
your API is in (e.g. knowledge of all the Facebook Graph
entities/relationships).</li>
<li><strong>It is to interact with some code.</strong> This code may not be defined
yet (in the case of specification writing), or it may be concrete.
The important point to note is that APIs implies a concrete
implementation <em>somewhere.</em>This has implications on the first two
points. If you are not the one writing the concrete implementation,
you need to be extremely thorough when specifying the interfaces in
order to convey your intent correctly. Common pitfalls here are not
specifying edge cases absolutely unambiguously (e.g. can this be
null? Is 0 a valid value?)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does the API do?</strong></p>
<p>This is the single most important question when designing an API. What
is your goal/objective/aim here? This should ideally be represented as
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use cases</a> which are
agnostic to the API itself. You want use cases to be clear and concise
to a non-technical audience. This is not just for communication
purposes. Specifying use cases in pseudo-code like terms immediately
restricts how you think about the problem on a sub-conscious level and
affects your ability to come up with potentially better designs. For
example, a bad use case is something like &quot;Get the account, add some
money to it, store the account&quot;. This immediately evokes 3 API calls
(getAccount, addMoney, setAccount), whereas 1 may be the better solution
(depositMoney). A better description would be to &quot;deposit money into an
existing account&quot;. Use domain-specific words whenever you can, as it
will likely affect the names of your objects/entities.</p>
<p>A particularly gnarly problem comes when trying to extract use cases
from other people. People will often announce solutions or steps to
perform to solve the problem rather than say what the problem really is.
This is problematic because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It prevents you as a developer from seeing the whole problem. This
can lead to bad designs because you simply weren't aware of some
additional constraint or couldn't leverage a useful bit of
information.</li>
<li>The solutions presented may not be appropriate or well-thought out.
Rarely is the first design the best design.</li>
<li>You may miss important &quot;behind the scenes&quot; information such as
assumptions made and trade-offs considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always, always dig deeper. It is sometimes hard work to do this, but you
can save yourself a lot of time by getting clear and concise use cases
first, so you know what the aim of your API is. Now that you have your
use cases, you need to start designing the API...</p>
<p><strong>What you should think about when designing an API</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the guidelines when designing APIs go something like: &quot;Be
Consistent&quot;, &quot;Do one thing and do it well&quot; and &quot;Don't have surprising
behaviour&quot;. I couldn't find a comprehensive list of tips which I should
be thinking about when designing APIs. Then, I stumbled upon the 1996
paper &quot;<em>Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: A
'Cognitive Dimensions' Framework</em>&quot; by TRG Green and M Petre. They
focused on visual programming, but their cognitive dimensions apply
uncannily well to API design (Source:
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dimensions_of_notations">wikipedia</a>):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>*Abstraction gradient</strong> : What are the minimum and maximum levels
of abstraction exposed by the notation? Can details be encapsulated?*</li>
<li><strong>*Closeness of mapping</strong> : How closely does the notation correspond
to the problem world?*</li>
<li><strong>*Consistency</strong> : After part of the notation has been learned, how
much of the rest can be successfully guessed?*</li>
<li><strong>*Diffuseness / terseness</strong> : How many symbols or how much space
does the notation require to produce a certain result or express a
meaning?*</li>
<li><strong>*Error-proneness</strong> : To what extent does the notation influence the
likelihood of the user making a mistake?*</li>
<li><strong>*Hard mental operations</strong> : How much hard mental processing lies at
the notational level, rather than at the semantic level? Are there
places where the user needs to resort to fingers or penciled
annotation to keep track of whatâ€™s happening?*</li>
<li><strong>*Hidden dependencies</strong> : Are dependencies between entities in the
notation visible or hidden? Is every dependency indicated in both
directions? Does a change in one area of the notation lead to
unexpected consequences?*</li>
<li><strong>*Juxtaposability</strong> : Can different parts of the notation be
compared side-by-side at the same time?*</li>
<li><strong>*Premature commitment</strong> : Are there strong constraints on the order
with which tasks must be accomplished? Are there decisions that must
be made before all the necessary information is available? Can those
decisions be reversed or corrected later?*</li>
<li><strong>*Progressive evaluation</strong> : How easy is it to evaluate and obtain
feedback on an incomplete solution?*</li>
<li><strong>*Role-expressiveness</strong> : How obvious is the role of each component
of the notation in the solution as a whole?*</li>
<li><strong>*Secondary notation and escape from formalism</strong> : Can the notation
carry extra information by means not related to syntax, such as
layout, color, or other cues?*</li>
<li><strong>*Viscosity</strong> : Are there in the notation any inherent barriers to
change? How much effort is required to make a change to a program
expressed in the notation? There are 3 types: &quot;Knock-on&quot;: a change in
the code violates internal constraints in the program, whose
resolution may violate further internal constraints*.<em>&quot;Repetition&quot;:
a single action within the userâ€™s conceptual model requires many,
repetitive device actions. &quot;Scope&quot;: a change in the size of the input
data set requires changes to the program structure itself.</em></li>
<li><strong>*Visibility</strong> : How readily can required parts of the notation be
identified, accessed and made visible?*</li>
</ol>
<p>To highlight some examples of what these dimensions mean:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you're writing a pet store API, you would expect to see a Pet
object and a Customer object (<strong>#2 - Closeness of mapping</strong>).</li>
<li>An API with an addFoo function should have a removeFoo function (<strong>#3
- Consistency</strong>)</li>
<li>To send instant messages to another user, a bad API may accept 2x
User, a Route, a TargetDevice, MessageContents and MessageMetadata.
This requires far too many moving parts in order to produce a result
(<strong>#4 -</strong> <strong>Diffuseness / terseness</strong>). It's worth noting that having
too few objects is also bad, if it isn't representative of the
problem domain.</li>
<li>APIs which rely on being called in a certain order (<strong>#5 - Error
proneness, #9 - Premature commitment)</strong></li>
<li>Errors should be informative and clearly identify the problem (<strong>#10
- Progressive evaluation</strong>). Note that this clarity applies to the
<em>API</em> and not to the <em>implementation</em>, e.g. returning HTTP 500 when
there is an <em>implementation error</em>is appropriate.</li>
<li>Tightly coupled components (<strong>#13 Viscosity (Knock-on)</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a good talk on API design (with an emphasis on Java), I would
recommend <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heh4OeB9A-c">Joshua Bloch's Google Tech
Talk</a>. It's an hour long
but has a lot of practical advice which I'm not going to (badly) rehash
here in this blog post. Once you've distilled this information, you need
to actually come up with a proposal. Don't try to be perfect, and
instead aim to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep it as simple as
possible</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid development</strong></p>
<p>When you have a proposed design, you need to see if it is fit for
purpose. You should quickly write up a prototype which demonstrates the
proposed design. This is hard to do because there aren't a lot of tools
to do this currently (I'll cover this in part two). The prototype need
not be code. Worked examples on paper using the proposed design can work
just as well.</p>
<p>The whole point of trying out the design is to be able to prove that the
14 dimensions outlined earlier are met satisfactorily. Often, <strong>there
will not be a simple pass/fail</strong> to each dimension. A lot of these
dimensions are subjective e.g. #5 - estimating the likelihood of the
user making a mistake. You'll probably find some flaws in the original
design. There will be disagreements among people about which dimensions
are important. That's the point. Iterate on the design a few times, and
when you (and your team) are happy with it, write up a prototype in code
if you haven't already.</p>
<p>At this point, it's extremely tempting to say that the API is complete
and act as if the API is set in stone. This is a mistake. The point of
writing a prototype in code is not to &quot;finalise&quot; the API. It is to
exercise parts of the API which people may not have thought about. You
may find yourself calling the same functions in the same order over and
over, which you never thought about before. You may find edge cases
where you lack all the information you need to make a decision due to
some race conditions. The prototype is serving as the ultimate test of
your API. Modify it liberally. Don't be tempted to set your API in stone
yet. How long you remain in this process depends on the time
constraints. When the API hasn't changed for a while, it's a good
indication that the API has reached a natural equilibrium. This doesn't
necessarily mean it is the best solution, it just means it has reached a
local minima. This is the ideal point to make the API public.</p>
<p><strong>Future-proof your API</strong></p>
<p>You should assume that the first public API will be replaced completely.
This means designing in version numbers from day 1. You should consider
how flexible the API is to modification. For example, it is a lot easier
to add new JSON keys to a JSON object than it is to rename keys. That
being said, try not to &quot;organically grow&quot; your API or else you can end
up with some odd, confusing or surprising behaviour.</p>
<p>An example of an inflexible API is Android's permissions model, in
particular push notifications. The permission depends on a string
constant which was originally set to
<tt class="docutils literal">com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE</tt>. This was named after
Cloud-to-Device Messaging (C2DM) which was the API they presented at the
time to send push notifications. Fast forward several years and this is
the <em>only</em>reference to C2DM remaining. The API was superceded by
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) but because they baked-in the name of the
API into the Android permission constant, they couldn't ever update it.
Now in practice, this doesn't really matter because most people just
copy and paste the string and couldn't care less about what it means.
However, anyone looking at the API can see this relic which developers
are stuck with forevermore. Google had a choice to either leave the wart
alone or break backwards-compatibility with apps which used the old
string constant. They decided to leave it as it was, which I think was
the right choice.</p>
<p>Always be thinking about extensibility when modifying the API. You may
have heard the saying &quot;It's easier to add than it is to take away&quot; used
in reference to API design. This is absolutely true. You can always add
more methods, more REST endpoints, more helper functions, but the moment
you want to <em>remove</em>a REST endpoint or an obsolete interface function,
things break and you start getting hate mail. Add things
<em>sparingly.</em>This should be thought of as a stronger version of
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>,
because the scope for things to go wrong is that much bigger. If you're
thinking you &quot;probably&quot; will need this in the future, <strong>don't add it</strong>.
You need to be certain; if it isn't blocking progress then you don't
need it. It's easy to add it in later and you don't break other people's
code when you push a new version out. Rather than getting hate mail,
you'll be getting praise because you've added support for
super-awesome-thing-#4.</p>
<p><strong>Tools and techniques</strong></p>
<p>Part two will outline some useful tools and techniques you can use when
designing APIs. This will focus more on the actual &quot;doing&quot; part of API
design rather than the ideals you should be shooting for.</p>
