Just as there exists a [project management triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle)
(Fast, Good, Cheap, pick 2), there also exists a software development triangle (Features, Time, Complexity).
In essence, they are both describing the same thing:
 - Some measure of time.
 - Some measure of cost (be it physically tangible or [otherwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)).
 - Some measure of quality.

Good programmers constantly strive (in vain?) to achieve all three goals at once, and this blog will talk a lot about:
 - Doing things faster (tooling, IDEs, code familiarity)
 - Reducing complexity (managing dependencies, bitrot, simplicity)
 - Producing better programs (speed, reliability, actually doing what the intended aim was)
 
So if you're interested in that sort of thing, read on.
