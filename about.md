I'm a software engineer based in London. I received my Comp Sci Masters degree in 2012. I have written a lot of code in Java, Javascript, Python and Go. Most of the code I write is available at {% include icon-github.html username="Kegsay" %}.

I'm interested in the overarching themes of software development: 
 - how fallible humans can write infallible code. 
 - the tradeoffs made when designing solutions.
 - how programming languages/tools can change productivity by orders of magnitude (both ways!)
