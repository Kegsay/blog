      Intent-driven APIs
    </a>
  </h1>
  <div class="post-date">Nov 12, 2016</div>
  <p>API design is Hard. There are hundreds of decisions you need to make when designing a new API.
There’s a long list of software design philosophies which can help you make these decisions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">least astonishment</a>.</li>
  <li>Having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">sensible defaults</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on. Even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">Zen of Python</a> are good guiding
principles when designing a new API, be it an HTTP API or an API for a specific programming language. I’ve
read an awful lot about API design, and made my fair share of mistakes designing APIs. I’ve learnt a lot in
the process. One thing that I wish I was told, and yet very rarely see on programming blogs/books, is the
idea of <strong>intent-driven</strong> API design. That is what this post is about.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-intent-driven-api-design">What is Intent-Driven API design</h2>

<p>In essence, intent-driven API design involves writing APIs to work in a way which meets the intention
of the user. This sounds obvious, so let me explain with some fictitious examples. What we’ll notice is
that the intent of the user is often very different from the actual implementation details, and
therein lies the problem.</p>

<h3 id="example-voip">Example: VoIP</h3>
<p>Let’s say we’re making a VoIP API. We can place calls, receive calls, answer/reject calls and hangup.
These operate on underlying “data streams” which need to be set up and torn down when the call is
answered/hung up, and it might take some time to do both of those operations. What might the hangup
function look like? <em>The following examples assumes knowledge of coroutines / async functions</em>.</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Call</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">hangup</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataStream</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataStream</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">tearDown</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Aha, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">tearDown</code> might take some time. We probably want to tell the user when they have successfully hung up, right?
So let’s fix that up:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Call</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">hangup</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataStream</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataStream</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">tearDown</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Great! Now what might an actual developer <em>do</em> with this function? Well, they might call <code class="highlighter-rouge">hangup()</code> in response to a
button click on the UI, and change the UI when the call has finished:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">onHangupClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hangup</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// change the UI</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now comes the fun part. What does the <code class="highlighter-rouge">answer</code> function look like? We need to be careful not to set the stream up
twice. Perhaps:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Call</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">constructor</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
    
    <span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">answer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_answering</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataStream</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Already answering/answered"</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="c1">// assume setup cannot fail</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">dataStream</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_setupDataStream</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_answering</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We have just created a racey API. What happens if the user does:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">call</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Call</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">answer</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hangup</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">hangup()</code> code will do nothing because there is no data stream yet. This is a fact of life.
The streams take time to set up and tear down, and the API is just telling the user the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. The problem is that most of the time the user of the API doesn’t care about the truth. They just
want to hangup the call. This is where you have a choice: Do you accommodate their whim and gloss over the fact
that these things take time, or do you tell them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a> because this is
how it is. If we do <strong>NOT</strong> accommodate their whim, what happens? They have this bug they want to fix. How can
they fix this? Perhaps they should wait until the answer completes first:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">answerPromise</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">onAnswerClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">answerPromise</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">answer</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="nx">answerPromise</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">answerPromise</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c1">// change the UI</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">onHangupClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">answerPromise</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="nx">answerPromise</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hangup</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// change the UI</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now you might have noticed a pattern here: <code class="highlighter-rouge">answerPromise</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Call._answering</code> are <em>the same thing</em>. The user
of the API is effectively <strong>copying over the state machine</strong> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Call</code> so they can call the right methods at the
right times. This is awful, but a lot of APIs do this. How else could this have been done?</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our choice and instead decide to accommodate their whim. What does <code class="highlighter-rouge">Call</code> naturally look like now?</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Call</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">constructor</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
    
    <span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">answer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// if not answering a call</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We’ve shifted the complexity to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Call</code> object now, so what does the user’s code look like now?</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">onAnswerClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">answer</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// change the UI</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">async</span> <span class="nx">onHangupClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">await</span> <span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hangup</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// change the UI</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’s a lot better! They no longer need to remember what state the call is in, and it greatly simplifies their code.</p>

<h3 id="example-instant-messaging">Example: Instant Messaging</h3>
<p>Let’s say we’re making an IM API. We have the concept of “rooms”. Members need to inside a “room” before they can speak,
and their message goes to every member of the room. Members may have different privilege levels which prevent them from
speaking. What does the speak function look like? <em>These examples omits all kinds of errors and asynchronous concerns
for simplicity</em>.</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Room</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">isInsideRoom</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hasPermissionToSpeak</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"You cannot speak in this room."</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="c1">// send message to the room</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>How might a developer use this function? Perhaps when they hit a “SEND” button:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">onSendClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getTextFromInputBox</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>But this will throw an error if they aren’t inside the room or have permission to speak. So they need to check this first:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">onSendClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">isInsideRoom</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">enter</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// assume this can never fail and is synchronous</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hasPermissionToSpeak</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">requestPermissionToSpeak</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// assume this can never fail and is synchronous</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getTextFromInputBox</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice the pattern? They’re performing the exact same checks as <code class="highlighter-rouge">speak(text)</code> because the API <strong>is forcing them to</strong>. This
is just a very simple example. It can quickly spiral out of control. Perhaps you need to already be in the room before you
can request permission to speak (so ordering now becomes important). The user of this API now has to know a great deal about
the internal state of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Room</code> in order to actually use it. How might this be improved? Helper methods are the key here:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Room</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">forceSpeak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">isInsideRoom</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">enter</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hasPermissionToSpeak</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">requestPermissionToSpeak</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This means that the naive <code class="highlighter-rouge">onSendClick</code> we had at the beginning would work with this function:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">onSendClick</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getTextFromInputBox</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nx">room</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">forceSpeak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are a few guiding principles you can apply to get a good feel for if you’re accommodating the
user’s intent. Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the <strong>ordering</strong> of function calls matter? If so, why not have a helper method Do The Right Thing
for your users?</li>
  <li>Are there <strong>timing</strong> issues with your functions? Does everything blow up if you call a function at
“the wrong time”? Can you can hide away these timing problems from your users?</li>
  <li>Does it matter which <strong>thread</strong> you call a function on? If you always need to be on, say, the UI thread
in order to call function X, can you dispatch inside the function and save your users the pain?</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst most programming languages have got the idea of <code class="highlighter-rouge">input -&gt; do stuff -&gt; output</code> down well, these
three points are much more hand-wavey. API users have to <em>rely</em> on documentation to let them know when, how
and where they can call functions. Try to make it easy on them.</p>

      Why manage dependencies?

  </h1>
  <div class="post-date">Nov 9, 2016</div>
  <p>We’re always told:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make your code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosely coupled</a>!</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a>!</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">Hide information</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>But have you ever thought “why bother”? It nearly always slows you down, so why don’t we just:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep classes tightly coupled and just use the bits you require. You probably aren’t ever going to need the class elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Make liberal use of singletons accessed directly in code.</li>
  <li>Leave everything publicly accessible: <a href="https://www.python.org/">we’re all consenting adults here</a>, amirite?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many reasons why we shouldn’t do these things: I’m going to focus solely on the dependency aspects in this post.</p>

<h2 id="code-changes-over-time">Code changes over time</h2>

<p>First, you need to convince yourself that the demands placed upon the code you write <strong>will</strong> change over time. Requirements change. Management wants <code class="highlighter-rouge">$FEATURE</code> ready by yesterday. Startups “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_jargon">pivot</a>” to new ideas as the market changes. Assumptions you originally made when writing the code are no longer valid and your code needs to be changed to reflect reality. It happens. <strong>It’s inevitable.</strong> No matter what the reason is, your next step will be to <em>change perfectly working code</em>. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” isn’t an option here.</p>

<h2 id="changing-code">Changing code</h2>

<p>To change code you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work out <em>what</em> needs to be changed in the code.</li>
  <li>Find the exact code to change.</li>
  <li>Change it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy, right? Are we missing anything though? Were other parts of the program relying on some behaviour you have now changed? Enter: dependency management. <strong>THIS</strong> is why dependencies matter. You don’t know what you may have broken when making this change. How do you find out what you may have broken? In most languages, you just find out what calls the function. You begin to form a <strong>dependency graph</strong><sup><a href="#deps">1</a></sup> of things that call that function. But that’s the simple bit. The harder bit is working out what preconditions have been potentially broken due to your new code. For example:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">payPerson</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">payer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">payee</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">amount</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">payee</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">balance</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nx">amount</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">payer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">balance</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="nx">amount</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">payer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">balance</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">sendEmail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">payer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"You are now overdrawn."</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nx">chargeInterest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">payer</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>The new code prevents Alice from ever getting overdrawn and charged interest. It’s easy to see here, but in a complex codebase this can be really tricky to see how adding code can subtly break preconditions that other code were relying on (in this case, the ability to have a negative balance). This happens relatively infrequently however. Most of the time you can check for broken changes by leaning on your tools: IDEs often have “Find Usage” functions and there’s always grep, right<sup><a href="#reflection">2</a></sup>? But what happens if you actually find out you have broken something? You MUST fix it <strong>before</strong> you can land <code class="highlighter-rouge">$FEATURE</code>, or else it won’t work. So you do the same 3 steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work out how this piece of code was using the function before. Work out <em>what</em> needs to be changed.</li>
  <li>Find the code to fix.</li>
  <li>Change it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rinse and repeat. On bad codebases this can end up with many disparate code alterations to add in a single change/feature/bugfix. On really bad codebases it may turn out to be <strong>impossible</strong> to realistically make the desired code alteration because it would require completely re-architecting the project. The project ends up <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Gradual_Petrify_(status)">gradually petrified</a> and there is no realistic way out of it. How could this have been avoided?</p>

<p><a name="deps">1</a>: <em>It’s important to point out that the dependency graph you form transcends any kind of “Public API” you may have cobbled together. It doesn’t matter if you use microservices, RPC or monolithic programs: the real API includes the cut corners: from the gut-wrenched variables to the raw SQL queries / HTTP hits which bypass the nice public API.</em></p>

<p><a name="reflection">2</a>: <em>This works up to a point: if your project makes liberal use of reflection / metaprogramming then these aids will not help you. This</em> <strong>includes use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer</a> pattern</strong><em>, which makes all your dependencies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_invocation">implicit</a> in the name of “decoupling”.</em></p>

<h2 id="minimise-dependencies">Minimise dependencies</h2>

<p>The problem we encountered when changing code was that we kept having to “hop” from one section to another to follow the dependency graph. An easy solution would be to not have code depend on other code, but that simply isn’t realistic. There’s always dependencies: <em>something</em> must be using the code you have written else it shouldn’t exist in the first place. If you accept that, then there will always be a dependency graph: <strong>but you can shape how it looks</strong>. In order to do that, you need to have a clear idea of what it looks like. This is very hard to do when all your dependencies are implicit (e.g. accessing singletons directly in functions). This is where the idea of “loosely coupled” components and dependency injection come from. They help to reveal the hidden world of dependencies in your code, so when you want to change it you can do so more easily.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can reduce the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">reach</a>” of a dependency if changes don’t leak beyond the immediate dependents. That is to say, if function A calls function B which calls function C, changes to C should not result in A changing, only B.</p>

<p>Let me take this moment to emphasise that you can take dependency management <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">to the extreme</a>. I <strong>strongly</strong> disagree with complex <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/">DI frameworks</a> that do nothing but obscure your code: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#Constructor_injection">there are clearer alternatives</a> which work in all languages.</p>

<p>If you search for it, you soon realise dependency graphs are everywhere but we don’t know what they look like or how deep they go. You find them in your package managers, your OS, your LAN and your HTTP APIs. You’re literally drowning in implicit and explicit dependencies. But this is the nature of software development. Provided everything works, complex dependency graphs are fine. It’s only when something <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">breaks</a> do we realise how big the house of cards really is.</p>

<p>So consider what your dependencies are. Prune the needless ones. Reduce the “reach” of the remainders and keep them clear to see. This takes time. There is no silver bullet.</p>

      The software development triangle
    </a>
  </h1>
  <div class="post-date">Nov 9, 2016</div>
  <p>Just as there exists a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">project management triangle</a>
(Fast, Good, Cheap, pick 2), there also exists a software development triangle (Features, Time, Complexity).
In essence, they are both describing the same thing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some measure of time.</li>
  <li>Some measure of cost (be it physically tangible or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">otherwise</a>).</li>
  <li>Some measure of quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good programmers constantly strive (in vain?) to achieve all three goals at once, and this blog will talk a lot about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Doing things faster (tooling, IDEs, code familiarity)</li>
  <li>Reducing complexity (managing dependencies, bitrot, simplicity)</li>
  <li>Producing better programs (speed, reliability, actually doing what the intended aim was)</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you’re interested in that sort of thing, read on.</p>
